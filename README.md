# Stagehand - Angular 2 Fork

This is a (temporary) fork of [https://github.com/google/stagehand](stagehand) for people that want to give angular 2 an early try. Once angular 2 is ready, stagehand will probably come with their own templates for angular 2.

To activate the fork:
```
pub global activate --source git https://github.com/kasperpeulen/stagehand
```

To create a new angular 2 template:

```
mkdir fancy_project
cd fancy_project
stagehand ng2
```

If you want a template with routing:

```
stagehand ng2-router
```
